# Tata's GenAI Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation

This repository contains my work and insights from Tata's GenAI Powered Data Analytics job simulation on Forage.

## Overview

During this simulation, I completed a comprehensive project focused on AI-powered data analytics and strategic solution development for the Financial Services team at Tata iQ. The experience combined exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and AI-driven automation design to address real-world credit risk challenges.

## Key Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Utilized GenAI tools to perform thorough EDA, assessing dataset quality, spotting missing values, and identifying key risk factors impacting customer delinquency.

- **Predictive Modeling Framework:**  
  Proposed and justified an initial no-code predictive modeling approach leveraging GenAI-generated model logic. Focused on assessing delinquency risk using decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks while considering ethical evaluation metrics.

- **AI-Driven Collections Strategy:**  
  Designed a scalable collections system harnessing agentic AI and automation. The strategy emphasizes ethical AI principles, regulatory compliance (e.g., ECOA, GDPR), fairness, explainability, and human-in-the-loop oversight for responsible decision-making.
